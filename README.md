# Waseda-Project
Our final project for advanced computer programming at SILS

**Requirements**
* Object-Oriented
* Makeuse of hierarchy, polymorphism and encapsulation
* Override operators
* Be split in different packages
* Make use of CSV files for loading data
* Make use of text files for writing data
* Feature also user input
* Use exceptions
* Do something useful/nice (similarly to the horoscope bot or the song sorting programs developed in class)

**Goals**
* Have user sign into Gmail using Gmail's API
* Iterate through emails, storing certain values in a CSV
* Analyze the data in some way

**Proposed Ways to Meet Requirements**
* Object-Oriented
* Make use of hierarchy, polymorphism and encapsulation
  * Can easily encapsulate certain methods or fields of a class
* Override operators
* Be split in different packages
* Make use of CSV files for loading data
  * Could write email data to CSV, then load that CSV in another part of the program
* Make use of text files for writing data
  * Might not need to be text - could export a graph or chart of some kind instead
* Feature also user input
  * Signing in to an email account should qualify as user input
* Use exceptions
* Do something useful/nice (similarly to the horoscope bot or the song sorting programs developed in class)
